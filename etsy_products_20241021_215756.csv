Our UV printing process promises lasting vibrancy, though slight variations in color may occur due to differing screens or logo formats. This is due to the difference in RGB (digital screen colours) and CMYK printed process colours - for further details, please ask

Although drafts aren&#39;t always required, we like to ensure the product you receive exceeds expectations. Connect with us via messages, and ask any questions you have before production. A draft will always be sent on all items before dispatch for approval to print and make.

Orders are only sent to print once the draft has been approved. However if a draft has been supplied, we have to account for reasonable time to reply, therefore we will print and manufacture the drafted product if we haven&#39;t heard back within 5 working days of us supplying the draft.

Once the order has been placed and a logo or file received, a draft is shared within 2 working days from order date, ensuring the final product aligns perfectly with your expectations. Plus, cancellation options are available pre-production only
